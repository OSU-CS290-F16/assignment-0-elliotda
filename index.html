 <ul><strong>Questions:</strong><br><br>
    <li>On a scale 0-10, how confident are you in your web development skills: <br><em> 1 </em> </li><br>
    <li>What do you learn to hope from this class: <br><em> All of the basics to web development</em></li><br>
    <li>Have you signed up for Piazza? <br> <em> Yes</em></li><br>
    <li>Interesting fact about me: <p><em>I've hung off the rails of a boat, in Alaska's open sea, with a fileting knife in my     teeth, like a PIRATE! This sounds cool, but it was actually very scary, and only done out of necessity. The short of the story     is, our boats engines got tangled up in fishing line and I had to cut them away, while wedging my ankles in between railings     so I didn't fall off the boat into the sea. The story is much more involved and if you're interested in hearing the full story    , ask me! </em></p><br>
