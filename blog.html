 <h2>Assignment 0: 9/25/16</h2>
 <ul><strong>Question(s):</strong><br><br>
    <li>What challenges or troubles did you have completing this assignent? How did you solve them? 
    <br><br><em>Everything was a challenge on this assignment because i've never really web developed anything before. 
    My first issue was not being able to accept the assignment 0. It kept saying permission denied. 
    I figured out that I needed to set up my VPN to OSU servers before it would work. 
    This was trail and error, no real help from any source. 
    Secondly I had trouble figuring out how to modify the readme.md file. 
    I looked to Piazza for help but nothing had been posted on it, so I assumed I was overlooking something simple.     
    Bahaha, it was just a click of a button on edit this file. Gah I'm dumb sometimes. 
    I had a much easier time with the index.html since it was demonstrated in class. 
    I just hope that I'm doing the assignment correctly, im doing the code directly in flip,like Rob demonstrated in class, 
    I just hope that's a correct way to complete the assignment. 
    My only problem with the index.html was getting the image to show up, which I'm still working on..BOO. 
    I've tried looking online for assistance but it looks like im doing this correctly, maybe it's because the image is on facebook, not sure. 
    I've tried putting the image in flip but I dont think I'm addressing it properly. 
    If I can't figure it out i'll turn to Piazza and/or ask during office hours. 
    Piazza to the rescue! Another student had the exact same problem as me, syntax! lol, src isn't the same as scr.
